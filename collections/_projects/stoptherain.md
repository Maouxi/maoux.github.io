Stop the rain with only one button to push! Why?! Just to give a try on the Flutter framework!

## Features

- Adjust how sensible you are to the rain
- If raining predict in how many time it will stopped (with 1 second prediction!)
- If no raining predict how many time is going to stay sunny
- Oh you have one prediction credit by hours. To get more you have to watch an ads ðŸ’©
